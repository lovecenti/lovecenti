- 💻 Who I've worked with:
Worked for rapper & singer JUMEX to create his website in 2022 (https://lovejumex.com).
Created a site for Texan agriculture company Agra Acres (2019) (site no longer online).

- 💻 What I've created:
Created several basic antivirus software (personal project).
Have created many backend panels & admin panels (on behalf of other people and myself).
Created many front-end websites (multi-page and landing page websites, I do good with both).
Created OS overlays (similar to Octoroit, created in VB).

- 👨‍💻 What languages I specify in:
Visual Basic Winforms: Learned this language as my first coding language in 2016. Have made hundreds of VB projects.
Visual C# Winforms: I learned this language after I learned VB sufficiently. C# was the second language that I learned.
PHP: Learning PHP since mid-2019, one of the languages I'm most experienced with.
HTML: Known intermedite HTML since early 2017, when I created personal websites.
CSS: Got into CSS in the last year, gotten the hang of most of the basic components. One of the languages I'm still working on.
MySQL: I've been learning MySQL for two years, using PhpMyAdmin to create and handle databases, and using the coding language in my PHP projects
to handle authentication.
Python: Know the basics of Python, but probably wouldn't have someone pay me to create something in Python, since I only know the basics of it.
